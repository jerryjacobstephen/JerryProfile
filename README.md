# About me
I come with an extensive 22+ years of experience delivering complex IT Cloud / Digital transformation and migration programmes, leading cross-functional teams, and embedding Agile practices. I offer a dynamic blend of strategic delivery leadership and deep technical expertise.
I find great fulfilment in roles within financial and Insurance, banking, academic institutions, and retail domains where I have the opportunity to collaborate with emerging talent and inquisitive minds. In an era defined by rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and digital innovation, I’ve consistently led technology initiatives that not only embrace emerging trends but also deliver measurable business outcomes. My experience driving cloud transformation, digital product delivery, and stakeholder engagement positions me to contribute meaningfully to organizations navigating this evolving landscape.
In my current role at Tata Consultancy Services, I have led multi-million-pound initiatives from inception to deployment, driving end-to-end delivery through effective stakeholder engagement, robust project planning, and continuous risk mitigation. My work has focused on tailored Scrum cadences, facilitating sprint ceremonies, and creating Power BI dashboards that visualise metrics such as velocity, cycle time, and defect density. These insights have enabled data-driven coaching and helped foster self-organising teams that consistently deliver high-quality outcomes with a growing focus on digital product lifecycle management.
My passion for Agile transformation has led me to guide organisations transitioning from Waterfall to Agile. I’ve built delivery frameworks from scratch, mentored teams through cultural shifts, and implemented automation tools like Power Automate to optimise workflows. Beyond coaching, my technical foundation enables me to collaborate closely with engineers, testers, and operations teams—developing integration solutions, define MVP across various technologies and legacy systems that adhere to security and compliance benchmarks.
I hold multiple industry-recognised certifications including Prince2 Agile, PSM I, Lean Six Sigma Green Belt, Agile Ninja Coach, and Microsoft Specialist in HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript. These complement my proficiency in JIRA, ServiceNow, MS Project, Power BI, Power Automate and SharePoint. My leadership style combines strategic vision with empathy, ensuring alignment across stakeholders and the growth of high-performing, delivery-focused teams.
